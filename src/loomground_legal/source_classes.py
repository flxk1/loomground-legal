"""Universal source-class map — the jurisdiction-AGNOSTIC half of applicable-law
theory.

The single-norm contract discipline reasons about *one* norm. This module lifts
the same discipline to the *graph of governing sources*: the question "which
sources of law govern these facts, with what force, and in what order?" Every
legal system answers it differently in the *particulars*, but the *shape* of the
answer is universal — and that universal shape belongs in the legal substrate,
not in any jurisdiction pack and not in a caller.

What is universal (here):
  * the **taxonomy of source *kinds*** — enacted law, judge-made law,
    international law, soft-law-with-effect. Membership differs by system; the
    kinds do not.
  * the **relation-type vocabulary** between sources — ``member_of``,
    ``incorporates``, ``transposes``, ``presumes_conformity``, ``outranks``,
    ``supersedes``. These are the dimensioned edge types emitted between sources.
  * the **effect ceilings** — a technical standard can *never* be binding (at
    most it raises a presumption of conformity); soft law is at most
    interpretive. Asserting otherwise is a contract violation in any system.
  * the **incorporation invariant** — a non-self-executing source (a directive,
    a treaty in a dualist system) does not bind the facts until it has an
    incorporation edge. *How* it is incorporated is a pack fact; *that* it must
    be is universal.

What is NOT here (it is pack data, in ``legal_systems.py``): the *ranking* of
classes within a family, which classes a given system self-executes, the
concrete incorporation rule (Art. 59(2) GG, Art. 216(2) TFEU), and membership
facts (DE ∈ EU). What is NOT here either: which classes are *in scope* for a
given task — that is the caller's scoping concern.

Pure stdlib, data + checks only.

Internal by design: auditable knowledge consulted by the applicable-law
resolver and the source validators; no surface of its own.
